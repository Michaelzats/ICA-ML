Installation:
Prerequisites:
* Python 3
* Google Colab (for running the provided notebook)

Installation steps:
* Clone the repository from Google Colab. (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1j-RytXdZDXCAWKHlaQdFWmRo64SJt_3Y?usp=sharing)
* Install necessary Python libraries using !pip install 
(
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install nltk
pip install gensim
pip install tensorflow
pip install keras
)

Usage:
Basic examples:
* Load the dataset provided “DATA.ZIP”. Do not unzip it before the excucution, the command # Once uploaded, unzip using: “!unzip DATASET.zip !ls” will do it.
* Train the model using the provided training set.
* Evaluate the model using the test set.

Detailed examples:
* The notebook provides detailed steps for implementing and evaluating each model.

Features:
* Classification of documents into predefined categories.
* Evaluation based on Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Accuracy.
* Use of various machine learning (Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest) and deep learning model (Deep Neural Network).

Limitations:
* The prototype is recommended to be run in Google Colab as it was created there and can not be simply transferred to the other environment 
* The prototype is computationally heavy, therefore it takes long time to run it through. 

Testing:
* The models are evaluated using the test set provided in the dataset.
* Evaluation metrics include Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Accuracy.
