        "In the realm of automated document classification, we embarked on an exploration to classify a diverse set of documents into predefined categories. The dataset under scrutiny, sourced from Kaggle, is titled \"[(10)Dataset Text Document Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jensenbaxter/10dataset-text-document-classification)\". It comprises documents categorized under the following labels: 'business', 'entertainment', 'food', 'graphics', 'historical', 'medical', 'politics', 'space', 'sport', and 'technology'. Each category is represented by 100 text files, culminating in a comprehensive dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the purpose of training and evaluation, the dataset was partitioned into a 70-30 split, with 70% allocated for training and the remaining 30% reserved for testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our investigative approach encompassed a range of machine learning models, namely Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest. Additionally, a Deep Neural Network, a paradigm of deep learning, was also employed. To enhance the performance and robustness of these models, various techniques were integrated into the pipeline:\n",

        "Model Ensembling: Bagging was used to reduce variance by training multiple models.\n",
        "Regularization Techniques: Dropout was introduced to prevent overfitting in the deep learning model.\n",
        "The models were evaluated on multiple metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Accuracy. The F1-Score, which harmoniously balances Precision and Recall, was chosen as the primary metric to determine the best model.\n",

        "Upon thorough evaluation, the SVM without any enhancements emerged as the superior model with an F1 Score of 0.9833512749362039. While other models with feature enhancements were closely competitive, the computational overhead and marginally inferior performance make the standardized SVM the recommended choice for this document classification task.\n",
